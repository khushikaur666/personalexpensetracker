# personalexpensetracker

I’ve always been really interested in personal finance, and I wanted a simple way to keep track of my expenses. So I decided to build this expense tracker, a tool I can easily access and use online to monitor my spending, categorize my expenses, and get a better understanding of my budget.

This project helped me combine my love for finance with a bit of coding practice.

The project is built in Python, and here’s a bit about how it works:

expense_tracker_gui.py: This is the main file that launches the user interface using tkinter. It lets you add, edit, and view your expenses in a simple, interactive GUI!

SQLite Database (expenses.db): All expenses are stored in a local SQLite database. The database is automatically created when you first run the program. Each expense has a date, category, description, and amount.

Categorization: Each expense can be categorized (e.g., food, transport, tuition, entertainment), making it easy to see where your money is going.
