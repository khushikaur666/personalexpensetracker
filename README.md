# personalexpensetracker

I’ve always been really interested in personal finance, and I wanted a simple way to keep track of my expenses. So I decided to build this expense tracker, a tool I can easily access and use online to monitor my spending, categorize my expenses, and get a better understanding of my budget.

This project helped me combine my love for finance with a bit of coding practice.

The project is built in Python, and here’s a bit about how it works:

expense_tracker_gui.py: This is the main file that launches the user interface using tkinter. It lets you add, edit, and view your expenses in a simple, interactive GUI!

Data storage: The tracker keeps your expenses organized in CSV files (or another simple format), so your data is saved between sessions.

Categorization: Each expense can be categorized (e.g., food, transport, tuition, entertainment), making it easy to see where your money is going.
